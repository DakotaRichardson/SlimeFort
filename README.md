## What is ooga booga?

Ooga booga, often referred to as a *game engine* for simplicity, is more so designed to be a new C Standard, i.e. a new way to develop software from scratch in C. Other than `<math.h>` we don't include a single C std header, but are instead writing a better standard library heavily optimized for developing games. Except for some image & audio file decoding, Ooga booga does not rely on any other third party code.

### A new C Standard

Let's face it. The C standard is terrible. Don't even get me started on `string.h`. To be fair, any mainstream language standard is terrible. 

So what if we could strip out the nonsense standard of C and slap on something that's specifically made for video games, prioritizing speed and *simplicity*?

That's exactly what oogabooga sets out to do.



## Known bugs
- Window positioning & sizing is fucky wucky
- Converting 24-bit audio files doesn't really work
